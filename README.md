# MidiCraft

MidiCraft is an experimental plugin for playing back MIDI files in Minecraft. MidiCraft is very picky with preferred files, as music at tempos more aligned to Minecraft's tick
speed will sound better and, additionally, music without drums will sound best (as MidiCraft only reads notes, not the instrument name - this could be improved upon).
